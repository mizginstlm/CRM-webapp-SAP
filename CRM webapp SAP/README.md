**Mozos Fiori Template Project**
I deleted some files for example base controller file because it was a completely private file.


This is a sap fiori web application, sapui5 and other sap extensions used. I added connections to databases and I added to github just with fake url's or names..
After you added some files that you needed you can run with npm start but don't forget to install npm.
